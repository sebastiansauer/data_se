Data Science Blog by Sebastian Sauer


I blog about data science, particularly using R, and with an applied interest to social sciences.

Posts reflect mostly my current thinking; and posts are not immune to thought updates. 
With luck things get less wrong in the course of time. 
All opions are my own. Faults are my own. 
Posts are organized as note books, as the crow flies, which is, as my thinking went.
