Much ado and to say about the p-value. Let me add one more point; actually not really from myself, but from @diez2012openintro, p. 189; good book in one is looking for "orthodox" statistics.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r fig.asp = .5}
ggplot(NULL, aes(c(-5,5))) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "grey40", xlim = c(-5, 2)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "#00998a", xlim = c(2, 5)) +
  labs(y = "",
       x = "X") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```


This picture should now be annotated with something along the lines

- "This is the distribution of $\bar{x}$ if $H_0$ is true" and
- "The green shaded area corresponds to the chance of observing $\bar{x}$ or a $\bar{x}$ even more favorable towards $H_A$".

Unfortunately, I have struggled to get annotations in this ggplot diagram with line breaks and with TeX fomulas (either one, no problem, both - did not work). That's why I have prepared the annotation with an external paint program, which worked like a charm.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/2017-11-29/p-Wert-Bild-crop.png")
```


The annotations are in German as I am planning to make use of it in class.
