Data Wrangling with dplyr is a popular activity in data science/ statistics. A number of tutorial are available, but not so many in German language.

Data set analyzed in `nycflights13::flights` (R package). Available on [CRAN.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html) Ok, choosing this data set is not very creative, but, hey, quite nice data:)

Thus, here is a cas[e study in German language](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/Fallstudie_Flights/); code (R)is on [Github](https://github.com/sebastiansauer/Fallstudie_Flights).
