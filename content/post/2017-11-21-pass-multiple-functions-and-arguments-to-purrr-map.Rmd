I just run in the following problem: I wanted to `map` *multiple functions* to multiple columns, and I needed to pass some arguments to this `map` call. Sound theoretical, I know. Consider this example:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Build a vector of functions:
```{r}
funs <- purrr::compose(median, mean, sd, IQR)
```

And apply this composed function to each column of a dataframe:

```{r}
mtcars[1:2]%>% 
  map(funs, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  map(funs, na.rm = TRUE)
```
