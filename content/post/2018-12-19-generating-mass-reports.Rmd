Sometimes, one document must be recreated in similar fashions a lot of times. For instance, invoices to customers, grading schemes for students, progress reports in projects, and so on. In this post, I demonstrate one way to do that in R using RMarkdown.




. 
Specifically, it is assumed that there's a tabular data, where each row is a document,
and each column holds the variables to appear in the reports. 
In addition, a template is provided where the variables are then parsed into. 
This template is built on latex, so that the output document is a pdf file.


## Installation and usage

1. Install R
2. Install LaTeX
3. Download/clone [this repo](https://github.com/sebastiansauer/rmd_mass_reports)
4. Set the folder as your working directory in R
5. Run `render_rmd_mass_report()` in `render_rmd_mass_report.R`, it is assumed that all files are in the same folder.





## Data file

`grades.csv` is a toy data file for illustration purposes. It consists of two rows (two reports) with three variables.


## Templates


### `grading_template.Rmd`

This file is a simple RMarkdown file that holds the overall document. 


### `latex-header.tex`

This latex file holds the Latex backbone for the Rmarkdown template. Notice that `dummy_logo.png` is read (and assumed to be in the same folder).


## Adjusting


Feel free to adjust to your needs. In many cases it may suffice not to touch the latex file. You need to make sure to change the variables in all sources:

- data file
- Rmd template
- render function `render_rmd_mass_report()` in `render_rmd_mass_report.R`


## Other stuff

`render_example_images.R` is a helper file in order to render the examples images (from pdf to png).



## Example time
