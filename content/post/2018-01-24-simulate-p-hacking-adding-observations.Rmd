Let's simulate p-values as a funtion of sample size. We assume that some researcher collects one data point, computes the p-value, and repeats until p-value falls below some arbitrary threshold. Oh and yes, there is no real effect.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
inc_data <- function(data){
  if (length(data) == 0) {
    out_data <- rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  } else {
    out_data <- c(data, rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1))
  }
}


```



Initital data point:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
data <- rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
