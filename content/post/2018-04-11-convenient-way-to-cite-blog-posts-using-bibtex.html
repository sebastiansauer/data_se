<p>Writing (scholarly) texts - a great way is using Markdown. Bibtext interacts nicely with Markdown, so one can easily cite literature.</p>
<p>One question that came up for me a couple of times recently was how to cite blogs in Bibtex?</p>
<p>I found this solution to be the most convenient:</p>
<pre><code>@misc{stats_test,
    Author = {Sebastian Sauer},
    Date-Added = {2018-03-29 13:54:38 +0000},
    Date-Modified = {2018-03-29 13:55:51 +0000},
    Doi = {10.17605/OSF.IO/SJHUY},
    Howpublished = {Data Set},
    Month = {01},
    Title = {Results from an exam in inferential statistics},
Year = {2017}}</code></pre>
<p>The important points are the <code>@misc</code> class, and the <code>Howpublished</code> field. Rendering this citation yields (in APA form):</p>
<p>Sauer, S. (2017, Januar). Results from an exam in inferential statistics. Data Set. <a href="doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/SJHUY" class="uri">doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/SJHUY</a></p>
<p>Which appears to me as a sensible solution. Note the inclusion of “Data set.” which is triggered by the <code>Howpublished</code> field. Previously I have been missing out this field when citing blogs, or more generally, web content.</p>
<p>It may well be that there are other and better approaches around, so inform me if you find some easier or prettier way.</p>
