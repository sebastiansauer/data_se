# Intro

A Gamma distribution is useful for modeling positive, right skewed data such as waiting times; it is a continuous function.


In this post, we'll illustrate some properties of the Gamma distribution by simulating a toy example.



# Simulate data and define structural model


Let $X$ be a discrete variable following uniform distribution, and  $x_i \in \{1,2,3\}$.

```{r}
set.seed(42)

n <- 1000
X <- sample(x = c(1,2,3), size = n, replace = TRUE)

hist(X)
```


Let $y_i = 0.1 + 1x_i$, by extension let $\hat{y_i} = 0.1 + 0.1x_i + \epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i \sim \Gamma(m = 0.1, \, s= 1/m)$, and $\Gamma$ refers to the Gamma distribution with location $m$ and shape $s$.


```{r}
e <- rgamma(n, shape = 0.1, scale = 1/0.1)
```


Compute $Y$ and $\hat(Y)$:


```{r}
Y = 0.1 + 1 * X
```


```{r}
Y_hat = Y + e
```


```{r}
hist(Y_hat)
```


```{r}
plot(X, Y_hat)
```


# Regression


```{r}
glm1 <- glm(Y_hat ~ X, Gamma(link = "log"))
summary(glm1)
```

# Coefficients, delogged

```{r}
exp(coef(glm1))
```
