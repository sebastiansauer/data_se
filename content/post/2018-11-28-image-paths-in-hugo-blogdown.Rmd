```{r knitr-steup, echo = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE,
  out.width = "100%",
  fig.align = 'center',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp =   .618,
  fig.show = "hold",
  size = "tiny"
)
```


Images from R are instantly included into (R) markdown files, and the 
same applies for blogdown posts.



See:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
plot(x)

```


However, for external images - such as photos - things are more complicated. First, all is still fine, if an image is found on some URL/server on the internet:


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/310px-R_logo.svg.png")
```

Of course, one can apply direct markdown syntax for including external images:

```
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/310px-R_logo.svg.png){width=20%}
```


![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/310px-R_logo.svg.png){width=20%}




Now assume we are in an R project that gives the base for a blogdown blog. Next, assume this is the relative path to the image:

```{r}
img_path <- "/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png"
```

Note the leading slash - without the slash it will not work.

This folder itself is found under `static` in the project root, 
within  blogdown folder.

BTW, the project root can be found like this:

```{r}
here::here()
```


Now, let's try to plot it using the following code:


```
![tidytext example](/post/2018-11-28-image-paths-in-hugo-blogdown_files/tidytext-crop.png){width=20%}
```

Note that we reduce the `width` of the image to 20%.



![tidytext example](/post/2018-11-28-image-paths-in-hugo-blogdown_files/tidytext-crop.png){width=20%}



There's a nice addin to RStudio which helps inserting external images, it's called [insert image](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/07/blogdown-insert-image-addin/#insert-image-addin-aka-the-easy-way) add in. Very useful.

Now, let's try the path as defines by `img_path` to render the image again:

```{r error = TRUE} 
knitr::include_graphics(img_path)
```



Worked out `r emo::ji("tada")`!
