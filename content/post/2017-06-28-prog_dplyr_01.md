Like for [others], Hadley Wickham's `dplyr`, and more generally, the `tidyverse` approach has considerably changed the I do data analyses. Most notably, the pipe (coming from `magrittr` by Stefan Milton Bache, see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)) has creeped into nearly every analyses I, do.

That is, is every analyses *except for* functions, and other non-interactive stuff. In those programming contexts, the dplyr way does not work, due to its [non standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) or NSE for short.

So, this post is about *programming* with dplyr, or more precisely, using the recently introduced [tidyeval](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) approach (approached into widely used R libraries, that is).

To understand the usecase, consider the following example. Say, we count the frequencies of some groups, and want to add the proportiong of these counts.


```r
library(tidyverse)
```



```r
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##     cyl     n
##   <dbl> <int>
## 1     4    11
## 2     6     7
## 3     8    14
```

Or, shorter `mtcars %>% count(cyl)`.


Now, let's add a column with the proporting of the count column (`n`).


```r
mtcars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##     cyl     n    prop
##   <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
## 1     4    11 0.34375
## 2     6     7 0.21875
## 3     8    14 0.43750
```


For extending this game to more than one variable, see [this post]().

Now, let's assume we would like to put the 'add a proportion column to my dataframe' in a function. How to proceed?

We might think this approach should work:


```r
add_prop <- function(df, count_var, group_var){
  df %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    group_by(group_var) %>% 
    mutate(prop =  count_var / sum(n()))
}

mtcars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  add_prop(count_var = n, group_var = cyl)
```

However, this does not work.

The dplyr 'verbs' expect *quoted* input variables. That means we must quote the parameters first, before we can hand over them to dplyr. `quo` basically means "hey R, don't yet evaulate this expression. Just read it, understand the name of the expression, and wait until I tell you. And R, understand, that you got an expression, not a simple text string". The last sentence tells us (or R) that we do not want a text string, but the quotation (or 'citation' of the expression if you like) of an expression to be evaluated in the futre.


```r
mtcars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  add_prop(count_var = quo(n), group_var = quo(cyl))
```

The important point is `quo`.


```r
quo(mtcars$cyl)
```

```
## <quosure: global>
## ~mtcars$cyl
```


But there's a second step we need to take. Now that `quo` has defined a quoted expression, the dplyr verbs do not need to quote their input variables, because they are already quoted. That is, we need to tell R now: "Hey, do not quote, evaluate! We have taken care of the quoting before".



```r
add_prop <- function(df, count_var, group_var){
  df %>% 
    mutate(prop =  (!!count_var) / sum(!!count_var))
}


mtcars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  add_prop(count_var = quo(n), group_var = quo(cyl)) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##     cyl     n    prop
##   <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
## 1     4    11 0.34375
## 2     6     7 0.21875
## 3     8    14 0.43750
```

Hizzah!
