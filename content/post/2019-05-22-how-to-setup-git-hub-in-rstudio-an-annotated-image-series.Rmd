There are many reasons to do version control. One is to allow Future You to understand what today's You did.

OK, it may help to like technology stuff. Some say, version control really makes sense only for larger projects (say, writing your thesis) or developing in a team. Software development practically always benefits from version control.

If you don't like memes and image-ladden stories, be warned, this post is not for you. And, it's an opinionated approach.

```{r define-paths, echo = FALSE}

proj_path <- here::here()

```




```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
recipe <- read.csv2(paste0(proj_path,"/Ressourcen/git-rstudio.csv"))



recipe <- recipe %>% 
  sjmisc::add_id()

knitr::kable(recipe)
```
