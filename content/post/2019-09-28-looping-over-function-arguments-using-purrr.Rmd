# Problem statement


Assume you have to call a function multiple times, but each with (possibly) different argument. Given enough repitioons, you will not want to repeat yourself.  
In other words, we would like to loop over function arguments, each round in the loop giving the respective argument'value(s) to the function.

One example would be to generate many random values but each with different mean and/or sd:


```{r}
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
rnorm(n = 2, mean = 0, sd = 2)
rnorm(n = 3, mean = 0, sd = 3)
# heck, my wrists strains!
```


Note that some arguments may not change.


# Enter purrr

One way to build a loop is using `purrr`.

First we define the list of arguments.

```{r}
args <- list(sd = c(1, 2, 3), n = c(1, 2, 3))
```


If we have some arguments that do not change, we can come up with a "prefilled" function, called a `partial` in purrr:

```{r}
rnorm_m0 <- partial(rnorm, mean = 0)
```


With `pmap` we can map many lists ("values", here: arguments and their values) to a function.


The following image taken from Hadley Wickham's book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html) helps to visualize what `pmap` does:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
pmap(args, rnorm_m0)
```

Alternatively, we can directly hand-over the "constant" argument to `pmap`:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
pmap(args, rnorm, mean = 0)
```
