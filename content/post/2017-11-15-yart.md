It would be useful to have a RMarkdown template for typical (academic) reports such as class assigments and bachelor/master thesises. The LaTeX class "report" provides a suitable format for that. This package provides a simple wrapper around this class built on the standard pandoc template.





## Thanks to
Yart, ie, this package leans on earlier work by [Aaron Wolen](http://aaronwolen.com/) in his
[pandoc-letter](https://github.com/aaronwolen/pandoc-letter) repository, and extends it for use from
R via the [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) package. The structure of this package is heavily inspired by Dirk Eddenbuettel's nice tamplate package [linl](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/linl).

The bulk of the work has been done by John McFarlane's [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), Donald Knuth's [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and Yihui Xie's [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), along with the earlier work of many.


# What is yart?

Yart is a R package that provides a RMarkdown template suitable for (academic) reports. Users write basically only content with a few metadata (such as title, school's name etc), and the template translates all that to LaTeX which is then being rendered to a PDF file.

The following screenshot shows on the left hand side the raw markdown file and on the right hand side the compiled pdf paper.

## Features

Being built on Pandoc, yart provides the typical features of Pandoc's Markdown, inculding citation, figures, tables and references thereto -- and basically, via a template, the fully featured LaTeX beauty. Being built on RMarkdown/knitr, R can be knitted into the text document.

The specific add-on of this template is that it configurates a LaTeX template suitable for (academic) reports so that the user does not have to deal with the LaTeX peculiarities and can focus on writing/contents. There are a number of levers which can be adapted by the used in the yart template including author name, title, subtitle, address, date, referee's name, assignment name, school's name, due date.



## Installation

Install via R from Github:

```r
devtools::install_github("sebastiansauer/yart")
```


>    LaTeX needs to be installed.

## Example

### Skeleton

The skeleton creates a very simple letter.

Several formatting defaults are in use. See `help(yart)` for a
complete list and default values.




### Vignette

The vignette example is a little more featureful and shows how to include a letterhead on-demand, a
signature, and a few formatting settings.


## Usage

First, open as a Markdown template via RStudio via *File > New File > RMarkdown > From Template > YART*. The template list or Rmarkdown should feature the YART template upon the package installation:

Second, "knit" to document to pdf:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastiansauer/yart/master/docs/knit_to_yart.png)


or use code such as

```r
library(rmarkdown)
draft("my_report.Rmd", template="pdf", package="yart", edit=FALSE)
render("my_report.Rmd")
```

to create a first draft of a new `my_report.Rmd`.
