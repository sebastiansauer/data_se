[Here](https://data-se.netlify.com/slides/ws-md-git-2019/ws-md-git-2019.html) are my slides for my Workshop on Markdown and Git (2019-09-16). Note that you need to be online to render the slides (due to heavy use of JS).

The Rmd source code (master file) can be found [here](https://data-se.netlify.com/slides/ws-md-git-2019/ws-md-git-2019.Rmd).

The PDF version of the slides can be found [here](https://data-se.netlify.com/slides/ws-md-git-2019/ws-md-git-2019.pdf).
