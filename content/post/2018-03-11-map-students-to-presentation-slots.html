<p>As a teacher, I not only teach but also assess the achievements of students. One example of a typical student assignments is a presentation. You know, powerpoint slides and stuff.</p>
<p>For that purpose, I often need to map students to one of several time slots. Here’s the R code I use for that purpose.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>How many students are subscribed to the assignment?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stud_count &lt;- 20</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say there 20 students in the course.</p>
<p>Let’s assume, for each time slot, 10 students can be allocated (not more time for more student for one slot).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slots_count &lt;- (stud_count / 10) %&gt;% ceiling  # round to next integer
slots_count
#&gt; [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>That gives 3 time slots.</p>
<p>Now let’s map the students to the slots on a random base:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slot &lt;- 1:max(slots_count)

set.seed(2018)
allocation &lt;- replicate(n = 10,
              sample(x = slot)) %&gt;% as.vector</code></pre>
<p>What we’ve done here is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Take the first triplet of students and randomly assign them to the three slots (so that each of the three students has a unique slot, ie sampling without replacement)</li>
<li>Repeat that for the rest of the triplets</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s check whether the <code>allocation</code> has worked:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(allocation)
#&gt; allocation
#&gt;  1  2  3 
#&gt; 10 10 10</code></pre>
<p>Worked out. Presentations ahead.</p>
<p>Let’s save the vector as a csv-file for the easy of interfacing with other applications such as Excel.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rio)
export(data_frame(slots = allocation),
       file = &quot;slots.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
