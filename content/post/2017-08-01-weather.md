In this post, we will explore some *date* and *time* parsing. As an example, we will work with weather data provided by [City of Nuremberg, Environmental and Meteorological Data](http://umweltdaten.nuernberg.de/en.html).

We will need these packages:


```r
library(tidyverse)  # data reading and wrangling
library(lubridate)  # working with dates/times
```


First, let's import some precipitation data:


```r
file_name <- "~/Downloads/export-sun-nuremberg--flugfeld--airport--precipitation-data--1-hour--individuell.csv"
rain <- read_csv2(file_name,
                 skip = 13,
                 col_names = FALSE)
```

```
## Warning in rbind(names(probs), probs_f): number of columns of result is not
## a multiple of vector length (arg 1)
```

```
## Warning: 300 parsing failures.
## row # A tibble: 5 x 5 col     row   col expected actual expected   <int> <chr>    <chr>  <chr> actual 1  1643    X2 a double      - file 2  1644    X2 a double      - row 3  1645    X2 a double      - col 4  1646    X2 a double      - expected 5  1647    X2 a double      - actual # ... with 1 more variables: file <chr>
## ... ................. ... ............................. ........ ............................. ...... ............................. .... ............................. ... ............................. ... ............................. ........ ............................. ...... .......................................
## See problems(...) for more details.
```

```r
colnames(rain) <- c("date_time", "precip")
```

As there was some strange, non-UTF8 character in line 12, we just skipped this line. As this was the row with the column names, we informed `read_csv` that there are no col_names (using `col_names = FALSE`). Also, some missing data occured. Luckily, `readr` takes care (despite of a lot of warning output).

Unfortunately, R has not yet reckognized that the first column consists of a date/time object. So let's tell her:


```r
rain$dt <- parse_date_time(rain$date_time, orders="dmy HM")
```

The parameter `order` tell R, that the format of `date_time` is day month year (hence `dmy`), followed by hour and minute (hence `HM`). Now let's spread the date/time to several columns:


```r
rain %>%
  select(-date_time) %>%
  mutate(day = day(dt),
         month = month(dt),
         year = year(dt),
         hour = hour(dt)) -> rain
```

Let's give each day a number, first day in record is #1, second day #2, and so on.


```r
rain$date <- date(rain$dt)

first_day <- min(rain$date)
last_day <- max(rain$date)

rain$day_ID <- rain$date - min(rain$date)
```



OK, now let's look at the precipitation in Nuremberg.


How many dry days (no rain) have there been in 2016?


```r
rain %>%
  group_by(day_ID) %>%
  summarise(precip_day_sum = sum(precip)) %>%
  filter(precip_day_sum == 0) %>%
  nrow -> n_dry_days

n_dry_days
```

```
## [1] 207
```

Oh, 207 out of 366 days no rain, ie., 0.55. BTW: It was a leap year, that's why I put 366 days.


```r
rain %>%
  group_by(day_ID) %>%
  slice(1) %>% nrow
```

```
## [1] 366
```

Easy enought, this little sweet function tells us whether a given year was a leap year or not.


```r
leap_year(2016)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Let's visualize whether a day was dry or not. First, we compute a variable `rain_today`.


```r
rain %>%
  group_by(year, month, day, day_ID) %>%
  summarise(rain_today = any(precip != 0)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(rain_today)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%   
  summarise(prop_rain_days_per_month = sum(rain_today)/n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = month, y = prop_rain_days_per_month) %>%
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)
```

August and September then were quite dry, it appears. Let's look at the amount of precipitation for comparison.



```r
rain %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(precip_mean_today = sum(precip, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = precip_mean_today)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +
  labs(title = "Total precipitation in liter per square meter")
```

For the fun of it, let's prepare a more nuanced picture.


```r
rain %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = date, y = hour, fill = precip) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b")
```

Hey, in June there must have been some heavy raining. Let's zoom in.



```r
rain %>%
  filter(month == 6) %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = date, y = hour, fill = precip) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 day", date_labels = "%d") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-08-01/figure/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)


Most of the days in June were dry, but on one day, heave rains occurred on the 12th or 13th in the late afternoon.


```r
rain %>%
  filter(precip > 7)
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 8
##   precip                  dt   day month  year  hour       date   day_ID
##    <dbl>              <dttm> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <int>     <date>   <time>
## 1    7.4 2016-05-29 21:00:00    29     5  2016    21 2016-05-29 149 days
## 2    9.5 2016-06-12 17:00:00    12     6  2016    17 2016-06-12 163 days
## 3    8.7 2016-06-12 18:00:00    12     6  2016    18 2016-06-12 163 days
## 4    7.2 2016-07-13 15:00:00    13     7  2016    15 2016-07-13 194 days
```

On June, 12th between 17:00 and 19:00 CEDT, a lot of rain came down in Nuremburg.


Is there a preference for time in terms of precipitation? Maybe it rather rains in the late afternoon in general?


```r
rain %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(precip_mean_per_hour = mean(precip, na.rm = T),
            precip_sd_per_hour = sd(precip, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = hour, y = precip_mean_per_hour) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = precip_mean_per_hour - precip_sd_per_hour,
                    ymax = precip_mean_per_hour + precip_sd_per_hour)) +
  geom_point(color = "tomato4")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-08-01/figure/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

Hm, not much difference between the hours. But the variability seems to differ quite some bit. Would that picture change if we consider only days *with* precipation?



```r
rain %>%
  filter(precip != 0) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(precip_mean_per_hour = mean(precip, na.rm = T),
            precip_sd_per_hour = sd(precip, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = hour, y = precip_mean_per_hour) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = precip_mean_per_hour - precip_sd_per_hour,
                    ymax = precip_mean_per_hour + precip_sd_per_hour)) +
  geom_point(color = "tomato4")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-15](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-08-01/figure/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

Not too much difference in the overall pattern. But what about if we look at the median and IQR, instead of mean and sd?



```r
rain %>%
  filter(precip != 0) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(precip_median_per_hour = median(precip, na.rm = T),
            precip_iqr_per_hour = IQR(precip, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = hour, y = precip_median_per_hour) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = precip_median_per_hour - precip_iqr_per_hour,
                    ymax = precip_median_per_hour + precip_iqr_per_hour),
                color = "grey60") +
  geom_point(color = "tomato4")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-16](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-08-01/figure/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

That the pattern breaks down essentially. Not that much difference between the hours left. Maybe 10:00 is rather dry, but that may be sampling errror of this year.
