<p>I would never write a paper again using Word - except I would be forced, too, what will happen, I think. But similarly, I don’t want to write papers using Latex - too many curly braces.</p>
<p>Best of both worlds: Markdown. Comes with “builtin” R.</p>
<p>Here’s an example how to do scholarly citation in markdown.</p>
<div id="in-text-citation" class="section level1">
<h1>In-Text citation</h1>
<p>Use this notation, to cite some book or paper or whatever:</p>
<pre><code>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly face similarly difficulties [@thedude2012].</code></pre>
<p>This sentence will be rendered to something like:</p>
<p>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly face similarly difficulties (Dude, 2012).</p>
<p>The format will depend on your chosen formation style, see below.</p>
</div>
