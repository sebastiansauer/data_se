<p>As a standard, bibtex is used as a citation-renderer in Pandoc’s Markdown, that is, in RMarkdown as well. bibtex is useful for a fair amount of citation task, but biblatex allows for a finer control. For instance, multiple bibliographies for one document are possible.</p>
<p>For instance, citing a newspaper article using bibtex left me scratching my head, as I wanted to have the <em>exact day</em> of the date (not only the year) cited. However, I could not convince bibtex to show these details.</p>
<p>That’s what I wanted to get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Krugman, P. (2013, 13. April). The Excel Depression. The New York Times, A31. Zugriff unter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-" class="uri">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-</a> excel-depression.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that’s what I got:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Krugman, P. (2013). The Excel Depression. The New York Times, A31. Newspaper Article. Abgerufen von <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/" class="uri">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/</a> krugman-the-excel-depression.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the difference in date formatting; for a newspaper article, one would want a day-based date, not a year-date only.</p>
<p>After some Google research, I found that bibtex appears rather limited in some nuanced fine tuning such as the exact day of an article. bibtex seems to have little patience for such subtleties.</p>
<p>By the way, that’s the bib(la)tex source of the citation just rendered:</p>
<pre><code>@article{Krugman:2013aa,
    Author = {Krugman, Paul},
    Date-Added = {2018-02-13 17:22:18 +0000},
    Date-Modified = {2018-02-13 17:23:26 +0000},
    Journal = {The New York Times},
    date = {2013-04-13},
    type = {Newspaper Article},
    url = {https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html},
    Pages = {A31},
    month = 04,
    day = 13,
    Title = {The Excel Depression}
}</code></pre>
<p>The following yaml header can be used to switch to biblatex for citation rendering:</p>
<pre><code>---
output:
  pdf_document:
    citation_package: biblatex

title: &quot;Untitled&quot;

lang: de-De

header-includes:
   - \usepackage{csquotes}

biblio-style: apa

bibliography: test.bib
#csl: &quot;/Users/sebastiansaueruser/Documents/Literatur/ref_mgt/apa.csl&quot;

---</code></pre>
<p>Note that no csl file is needed for biblatex, the specs are included in an included latex package (biblatex-apa). <code>csquotes</code> is a latex packages that helps to print non-English quotation marks such as Germans.</p>
<p>Below and beyond the yaml header, one continues as usual: citing the source, and not caring for the literature section, which will be put automatically to the end of the document.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s cite the Krugman article from the New York Times:</p>
<pre><code>@Krugman:2013aa</code></pre>
<div id="caveat" class="section level1">
<h1>Caveat</h1>
<p>The biblatex approach only works for Latex output (pdf) only, not for html.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For LaTeX output, you can also use natbib or biblatex to render the bibliography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pandoc.org/demo/example19/Extension-citations.html">Source</a></p>
<p>I’m no expert in biblatex, so there are surely aspects I’m not aware of.</p>
</div>
<div id="put-the-literature-section-at-an-arbitrary-place" class="section level1">
<h1>Put the literature section at an arbitrary place</h1>
<p>BTW, to have the literature section appear at some different point, and not necessarily at the very end of the document, use this approach.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;refs&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
