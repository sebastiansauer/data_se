Frequently, datasets have to be reshaped before further analysis. One particular important step is to transform a data frame from "wide" to "long" format. This is illustrated by the following diagram, taken from by [new book on data analysis](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783658215866) (Image licence: CC-BY-NC).


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/gather_spread.png")
```
