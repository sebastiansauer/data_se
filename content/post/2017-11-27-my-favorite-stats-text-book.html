<p>Some thoughts how my favorite <em>applied</em> stats text book would look like. I am looking at eg., business fields such as MBA as consumers.</p>
<div id="my-ideal-applied-stats-text-book" class="section level2">
<h2>My ideal applied stats text book</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>is case study oriented (“Assume you would like to predict which movie will score highest next year based on some movie characteristics you know”)</p></li>
<li><p>makes use of recent data analytics techniques such as tree based methods (Random Forests) or Shrinkage models (Lasso)</p></li>
<li><p>does not stop at explaining p-values and t-tests (which are of limited use in the real world)</p></li>
<li><p>show alternatives to the p-value, in fact does not make much use of p-values</p></li>
<li><p>introduces Bayes stats thoroughly</p></li>
<li><p>focus on the needs of the business world, not (primarily) on the stats needs of academia</p></li>
<li><p>is highly visually oriented, shows how to produce beautiful and effective data visualizations</p></li>
<li><p>is technology savy, does not ignore the plethora of new technologies out there from JavaScript libraries, to RMarkdown, Shiny, Docker, Github, parallel computing, big queries, and more</p></li>
<li><p>is fully reproducible, values open science</p></li>
<li><p>is fun to read.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This list is certainly up for thought updates. Let me know how your fav text book looks like.</p>
