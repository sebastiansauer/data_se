There's the new cool world of project management - agile, scrumbling, cool. There's the old sluggish way of project management using stuff like *gantt* diagrams. Let's stick to the old world and come up with a gantt diagram.

The gant diagram itself is no big deal. Just some horizontal lines referring to dates. Somewhat more interesting is to populate a raw data frame in a way that allows for convenient plotting.

Say we start with a basic dataframe (from a CSV file) that contains the following columns:

```{r}
gant_data_raw <- read.csv2("https://data-se.netlify.com/downloads/Arbeitspakete.csv")
```
