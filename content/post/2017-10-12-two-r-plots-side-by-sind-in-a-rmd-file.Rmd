UPDATE 2018-12-03

Thanks to a comment by [Katharina Hees](https://disqus.com/by/katharinahees/) and [Joyce](https://disqus.com/by/disqus_xUz2QLqWmM/), I know know how to plot two images side by side in an Rmd file.

I kept wondering who to plot two R plots side by side (ie., in one "row") in a .Rmd chunk. Here's a way, well actually a number of ways, some good, some ... not.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(png)
library(downloader)
library(grDevices)

data(mtcars)
```


# Plots from `ggplot`

Say, you have two plots from `ggplot2`, and you would like them to put them next to each other, side by side (not underneath each other):


```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = hp, y = mpg) +
  geom_point() -> p1

ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), se = FALSE) -> p2

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```


So, `grid.arrange` is the key.

# Plots from png-file



```{r}
comb2pngs <- function(imgs, bottom_text = NULL){
  img1 <-  grid::rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(imgs[1])),
                            interpolate = FALSE)
  img2 <-  grid::rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(imgs[2])),
                            interpolate = FALSE)
  grid.arrange(img1, img2, ncol = 2, bottom = bottom_text)
}
```


The code of this function was inspired by code from Ben
from this SO [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25415365/insert-side-by-side-png-images-using-knitr).

Now, let's load two pngs and then call the function above.


First, get the images:

```{r eval = TRUE}
png1_path <- "https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2016-08-30-03.png"
png2_path <- "https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2016-08-31-01.png"

#download(png1_path, destfile = png1_dest)
#download(png2_path, destfile = png2_dest)

png1_dest <- "/images/img1.png" 
png2_dest <- "/images/img2.png"
```


Now plot it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
comb2pngs(c(png1_dest, png2_dest))
```


<img src="https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This works, it produces two plots from png files side by side.

# Two plots side-by-side the knitr way. Does not work.

But what about the standard knitr way?


```{r eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(c(png1_path,png2_path))
```

<!-- <img src=""https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> -->
<!-- <img src=""https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img2.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> -->

Does not work.

Maybe with only one value for `out.width?`?


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(c(png1_dest, png2_dest))
```

<img src="https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><img src="https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img2.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />



Nope. Does not work.


Does not work either, despite [some saying so](http://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/).


Maybe two times `include_graphics`?


```{r eval = FALSE}
imgs <- c(png1_dest, png2_dest)
imgs
#> [1] "https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img1.png"
#> [2] "https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img2.png"

knitr::include_graphics(png1_dest);  knitr::include_graphics(png2_dest)
```

<img src="https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" width="20%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><img src="https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img2.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" width="20%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


# An insight why `include_graphics` fails

No avail. Looking at the html code in the md-file which is produced by the knitr -call shows one interesting point: all this version of `include_graphics` produce the same code. And all have this `style="display: block; margin: auto;"` part in it. That obviously created problems. I am unsure who to convince `include_graphics` to divorce from this argument. I tried some versions of the chunk argument `fig.show = hold`, but to no avail.



# It works with the right chunk options


To get the two images side by side (next to each other/ in a row), two options must be set

- the total width of the images must not exeed the maximum width
- the images should be shown after all codes is executed, ie., the images must be "held"


See this code snippet:


````
```{r out.width='30%', fig.show='hold'}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics(c(png1_path, png2_path))
```
````



```{r out.width='30%', fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(png1_path, png2_path))
```


# Plain markdown works, too

Try this code
```![](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img1.png){ width=30% } ![](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img2.png){ width=40% }
```
The two commands `![]...` need not appear in one row. However, no new paragraph may separate them (no blank line between, otherwise the images will appear one below the other).

![](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img1.png){ width=30% }
![](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-10-12/img2.png){ width=40% }

Works. But the markdown way does not give the fill comfort and power. So, that's not quite perfect.
