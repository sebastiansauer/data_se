Correlation is one of the most widely used and a well-known measure of the assocation (*linear* association, that is) of two variables.

Perhaps less well-known is that the correlation is in principle *identical to the covariation*.

To see this, consider ~~the~~ a formula of the covariance of two empirical datasets, $$X$$ and $$Y$$:

$$COV(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \big( \sum (X_i -\bar{X}) \cdot (Y_i - \bar{Y}) \big) $$

In other words, the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ $COV(X,Y)$ is the average of difference of some value to its mean.

This idea is conveyed by this picture:

# The covariance is identical to the correlation (?)
What does it mean to say the (coefficient of) correlation is "identical" to the covariation?

*If we "feed" z-scaled values to the covariation, we will get back the correlation*.

In other words, the correlation equals the covariation if the data are z-scaled.

So, let's see. We replace $$X$$ by $$z_X$$ and $$Y$$ by $$z_Y$$ and see what happens.

$$Cov(z_X, z_Y) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \big( \sum (z_{X_i} - z_{\bar{X}}) \cdot (z_{Y_i} - z_{\bar{Y}}) \big) $$

However, $$z_{\bar{X}} = 0$$, and by analogy, $$z_{\bar{y}} = 0$$. So the eqaution simplifies to

$$Cov(z_X, z_Y) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \big( \sum (z_{X_i} \cdot z_{Y_i}) \big) $$

Now, $$z_x$$ can be expressed as

$$z_x = \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{sd_X}$$

The same rule applies for $$z_y$$, by analogy.


Now, let's insert the previous equation in the equation of $$Cov(z_X, z_Y)$$:

$$Cov(z_X, z_Y) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \big( \sum \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{sd_X} \cdot \frac{Y_i - \bar{Y}}{sd_Y} \big) $$

$$sd_X$ and $sd_Y$$ can be pulled out of the sum, right at the front of the equation, leaving us with

$$Cov(z_X, z_Y) = \frac{1}{sd_X \cdot sd_Y} \cdot \big( \sum (X_i - \bar{X}) \cdot (Y_i - \bar{Y}) \big) $$.

And that's the definition of the correlation of $$X$$ and $$Y$$, more frequently put this way:

$$Cov(z_X, z_Y) = \frac  {\sum (X_i - \bar{X}) \cdot (Y_i - \bar{Y})}{sd_X \cdot sd_Y}$$.


Hence,

$$Cov(z_X, z_Y) = cor(X,Y)$$.

# Example time

It is helpful to consider an example.

This is a scatterplot of two variables, ie., "raw data" as is "fed in" for the calculation of the (empirical) covariation:


```r
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot +
  aes(x = hp, y = mpg) +
  geom_point()
```

And now, let's z-scale the two variables and draw the same diagram again:


```r
mtcars %>% 
  select(hp, mpg) %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(scale)) %>% 
  ggplot +
  aes(x = hp, y = mpg) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="https://sebastiansauer.github.io/images/2017-04-25/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="50%" />

Now, what's the difference? Nada, no difference. That's reassuring, because we just derived that the assocation of the variables is the same - no matter if use the raw data or z-scaled data as input. The diagrams confirms this in an more intuitive way.

# Summary

The correlation is a "special case" of the covariance; it is the case when we feed z-scaled data to the covariance.

Happy data analyzing!
