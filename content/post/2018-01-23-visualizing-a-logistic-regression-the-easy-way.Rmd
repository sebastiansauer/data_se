Let's visualize a GLM (logistic regression). 

First laod some data:


```{r}
data(tips, package = "reshape2")
```


Compute a glm:

```{r}
glm1 <- glm(sex ~ tip, data = tips,
            family = "binomial")
```

Plot the model using `mosaic`:

```{r message = FALSE}
library(mosaic)
plotModel(glm1)
```

The curve does not look really s-typed (ogive) but that's ok because the data suggest not a strong trend.
