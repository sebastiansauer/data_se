# Problem statement

My son, being a first grader, just struggled with this piece of math:



![](/post/2020-07-03-first-grade-math-exercise_files/math-grade1.jpg)





Consider this system of equations:


$$ a + b + c = 20\\
d + e + f = 14\\
g + h + i = 11\\
a + d + g = 15\\
b + e + h = 10\\
c + f + i = 20\\
a + e + i = 20\\
g + e + c = 10$$


In R:

Let $A$ be the LHS of the equation system:

```{r}
A <- tibble::tribble(
  ~a, ~b, ~c, ~d, ~e, ~f, ~g, ~h, ~i,
  1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L,
  0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L,
  0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L,
  1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L,
  0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L,
  0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L,
  0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L,
  1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L
  )

A
```

As matrix:

```{r}
Am <- as.matrix(A)
Am
```


```{r}
dim(Am)
```


So we have a system of 8 rows and 9 coefficients, that's a underdetermined system, hence there are more than 1 solution.


Let $X$ be the vector of coefficients.


Let $Y$ be the RHS of the system:


```{r}
Y <- c(20, 14, 11, 15, 10, 20, 10, 20)

Ym <- matrix(Y, ncol = 1)

Ym
```



# Solve it

Drawing from [this source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53009467/solving-underdetermined-linear-systems-with-r), we can solve underdetermined systems of equations like this:

```{r}
X <- qr.coef(qr(Am), Ym)
X[is.na(X)] <- 0

X
```


# Not a solution

I forgot to implement that only positive integers are allowed. Sigh.


# Here come the solution

My colleague [Norman Markgraf](https://github.com/NMarkgraf/), a true math guy, provided [this beautiful solution](https://gist.github.com/NMarkgraf/9d40f4f0c3943b41f3beeeb09916c446).

Thank you, Norman!
