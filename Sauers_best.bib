  abstract = {Job satisfaction is one of the most prominent working models of occupational and organizational psychology. So far, job satisfaction has been operationalized mainly as a one-dimensional model; this not only repeatedly led to mistakes but also to excessively positive judgements of the job satisfaction. The necessity to see the creation of job satisfaction as a much more complex process was taken into account by the Model of Different Forms of Work Satisfaction (Zurich Model) (Z{\"u}rcher Modell der Arbeitszufriedenheit) (Bruggemann 1974; Bruggemann 1976). The present article describes the empirical and theoretical evolution of this extensive model into the ``Zurich Model Revisited'' which offers the scientific basis for developing an innovative questionnaire (Ferreira, submitted 2017).},

  abstract = {Observation Oriented Modeling was proposed to overcome some of the problems in the application of statistical inference methods in the behavioral sciences. In this paper, we refine one part of this approach and show how it is connected to methods that are well known in statistical learning. Specifically, we argue that the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse is superior to the initial solution from a statistical point of view. With this we also show that Observation Oriented Modeling can indeed be appropriate for some tasks in the analysis of observed data. To provide a practical example, we demonstrate the revised method by analyzing the effect of mindfulness training on attentional processes.},
