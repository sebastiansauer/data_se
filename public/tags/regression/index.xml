      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) library(mosaic) library(plotly) library(scatterplot3d) library(rsm)  Motivation Linear models are a standard way of predicting or explaining some data. Visualizing data is not only of didactical value but provides heuristical value too, as demonstrated by Anscombe’s Quartet.
Visualizing linear models in 2D is straightforward, but visualizing linear models with more than one predictor is much less so. The aim of this post is to demonstrate some ways do visualize linear models with more than one predictor, using popular R packages.</description>

      <description>The logistic regression is an incredible useful tool, partly because binary outcomes are so frequent in live (“she loves me - she doesn’t love me”). In parts because we can make use of well-known “normal” regression instruments.
But the formula of logistic regression appears opaque to many (beginners or those with not so much math background).
Let’s try to shed some light on the formula by discussing some accessible explanation on how to derive the formula.</description>
