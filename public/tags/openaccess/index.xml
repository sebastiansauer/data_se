      <description>This post presents a compilation of links to psychology papers; I have chosen papers I find intriguing particularly for working in class. All papers are open access (or a from open access repositories) which renders classroom work easier. The papers are collected from a broad range of topics but mostly with focus on general interest. The perspective is an applied one; I have not tried to select based on methodological rigor.</description>
