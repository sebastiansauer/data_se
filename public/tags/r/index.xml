      <description>It is well-known that the empirical variance underestimates the population variance. Specifically, the empirical variance is defined as: \(var_{emp} = \frac{\sum_i x_i - \bar{x}}{n-1}\). But why \(n-1\), why not just \(n\), as intuition (of some) dictates? Put shortly, as the variance of a sample tends to underestimates the population variance we have to inflate it artificially, to enlarge it, that’s why we do put a smaller number (the “n-1”) in the denominator, resulting in a larger value of the whole fraction.</description>

      <title>Error bars for interaction effects with nominal variables</title>

      <description>Moderator effects (ie., interaction or synergy effects) are a topic of frequent interest in many sciences braches. A lot ink has been spilled over this topic (so did I, eg., here).
However, in that post I did now show how to visualize error in case of nominal (categorical) independent variable, and categorical moderator.
Luckily, visualization of this case is quite straight forward with ggplot2.
First, some data and packages to be loaded:</description>
