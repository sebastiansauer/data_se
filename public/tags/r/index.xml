      <description>Some thoughts on the “quality” of slide decks used in teaching: How many visuals are there? How much text is squeezed on a slide? What’s the average word and sentence length? How much buzz words and complicated jargon is present?
Let’s have an initial look at some meaures in that regard. Hey, this post is just playing around a little. We will work with this slide deck, published under CC-BY 3, with parts as GNU - so all “open” in short.</description>

      <title>Why &#34;n-1&#34; in empirical variance? A simulation.</title>

      <description>It is well-known that the empirical variance underestimates the population variance. Specifically, the empirical variance is defined as: \(var_{emp} = \frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}\). But why \(n-1\), why not just \(n\), as intuition (of some) dictates? Put shortly, as the variance of a sample tends to underestimate the population variance we have to inflate it artificially, to enlarge it, that’s why we do put a smaller number (the “n-1”) in the denominator, resulting in a larger value of the whole fraction.</description>

      <title>Error bars for interaction effects with nominal variables</title>

      <description>Moderator effects (ie., interaction or synergy effects) are a topic of frequent interest in many sciences braches. A lot ink has been spilled over this topic (so did I, eg., here).
However, in that post I did now show how to visualize error in case of nominal (categorical) independent variable, and categorical moderator.
Luckily, visualization of this case is quite straight forward with ggplot2.
First, some data and packages to be loaded:</description>
