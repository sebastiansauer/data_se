      <description>Images from R are instantly included into (R) markdown files, and the same applies for blogdown posts.
See:
x &amp;lt;- 1:10 plot(x) However, for external images - such as photos - things are more complicated. First, all is still fine, if an image is found on some URL/server on the internet:
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/310px-R_logo.svg.png&amp;quot;) Of course, one can apply direct markdown syntax for including external images:

      <description>I would never write a paper again using Word - except I would be forced, too, what will happen, I think. But similarly, I don’t want to write papers using Latex - too many curly braces.
Best of both worlds: Markdown. Comes with “builtin” R.
Here’s an example how to do scholarly citation in markdown.
In-Text citation Use this notation, to cite some book or paper or whatever:

      <title>Yart - Yet Another Markdown Report Template</title>
      <link>/2017/11/15/yart/</link>

      <description>It would be useful to have a RMarkdown template for typical (academic) reports such as class assigments and bachelor/master thesises. The LaTeX class &amp;ldquo;report&amp;rdquo; provides a suitable format for that. This package provides a simple wrapper around this class built on the standard pandoc template.
Thanks to Yart, ie, this package leans on earlier work by Aaron Wolen in his pandoc-letter repository, and extends it for use from R via the rmarkdown package.</description>
