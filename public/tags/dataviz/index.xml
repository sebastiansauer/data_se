      <description>Following up on an earlier post, we will model the voting success of the (most prominent) populist party, AfD, in the recent federal elections. This time, Bayesian modeling techniques will be used, drawing on the excellent textbook my McElreath.
Note that this post is rather a notebook of my thinking, doing, and erring. I‚Äôve made no efforts to hide scaffolding. I think it will be confusing to the uniniate and the initiate as well ‚Ä¶</description>

      <description>Say, you have to choose between two doctors (Anna and Berta). To decide which one is better, you check their success rates. Suppose that they deal with two conditions (Coolities and Dummities). So let‚Äôs compare their success rate for each of the two conditions (and the total success rate):
This is the proportion of healing (success) of the first doctor, Dr. Anna for each of the two conditions:
 Coolities: 7 out of 8 patients are healed from Coolities Dummieties: 1 out of 2 patients are healed from Dummities  This is the proportion of healing (success) of the first doctor, Dr.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs visualize a GLM (logistic regression).
First laod some data:
data(tips, package = &amp;quot;reshape2&amp;quot;) Compute a glm:
glm_tips &amp;lt;- glm(sex ~ tip, data = tips, family = &amp;quot;binomial&amp;quot;) Plot the model using mosaic:
library(mosaic) ## Warning: Paket &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; wurde unter R Version 3.5.1 erstellt plotModel(glm_tips) The curve does not look really s-typed (ogive) but that‚Äôs ok because the data suggest not a strong trend. The plot is not very beautiful either, but hey - it‚Äôs quick to produce üòÅ.</description>

      <description>Here come some stunning examples of data visualizations, all built with R. R code of each diagram is available at the source. Enjoy! #beautiful.
UPDATE: I&amp;rsquo;ve included links to the R source!
Plotting geo maps along with subplots in ggplot2 I like this one by Ilya Kashnitsky:
Similarly, by the same author:

Great work, @ikashnitsky!
