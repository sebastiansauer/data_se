      <description>Correlation is one of the most widely used and a well-known measure of the assocation (linear association, that is) of two variables.
Perhaps less well-known is that the correlation is in principle analoguous to the covariation.
To see this, consider the a formula of the covariance of two empirical datasets, $X$ and $Y$:
$$COV(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \big( \sum (X_i -\bar{X}) \cdot (Y_i - \bar{Y}) \big) $$
In other words, the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ $COV(X,Y)$ is the average of difference of some value to its mean.</description>

      <description>Pearson&amp;rsquo;s correlation is a well-known and widely used instrument to gauge the degree of linear association of two variables (see this post for an intuition on correlation).
There a many formulas for correlation, but a short and easy one is this one:
$$r = \varnothing(z_x z_y)$$.
In words, $$r$$ can be seen as the average product of z-scores.
In &amp;ldquo;raw values&amp;rdquo;, r is given by
$$ r = \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum{\Delta X \Delta Y}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum{\Delta X^2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum{\Delta Y^2}}} $$.</description>

      <title>Intuition on correlation</title>

      <description>reading time: 10 min.
Pearson’s correlation (short: correlation) is one of statistics’ all time classics. With an age of about a century, it is some kind of grand dad of analytic tools – but an oldie who is still very busy!
Formula, interpretation and application of correlation is well known.
In some non-technical lay terms, correlation captures the (linear) degree of co-variation of two linear variables. For example: if tall people have large feet (and small people small feet), on average, we say that height and foot size are correlated.</description>
