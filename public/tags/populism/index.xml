      <description>The last months (years? since ever???) have seen a surge in populism and a rise in nationalism. Not only in Russia, the United States, Turkey, but also in some EU countries the ghost of nationalism-populism seems to be marching and gaining ground.
As to Germany, in September 24, 2017, the 19. German federal elections took place. The newly founded alt-right AfD (Alternative for Deutschland) has made a leap and moved in the Bundestag.</description>

      <title>Mapping foreigner ratio to AfD election results in the German Wahlkreise</title>
      <link>/2017/10/22/afd-map-foreigners/</link>

      <description>In a previous post, we have shed some light on the idea that populism - as manifested in AfD election results - is associated with socioeconomic deprivation, be it subjective or objective. We found some supporting pattern in the data, although that hypothesis is far from being complete; ie., most of the variance remained unexplained.
In this post, we test the hypothesis that AfD election results are negatively associated with the proportion of foreign nationals in a Wahlkreis.</description>

      <description>There is the idea that the alt-right German party AfD is followed by those who are deprived of chances, thoses of fearing to falling down the social ladder, and so on. Let&amp;rsquo;s test this hypothesis. No, I am not thinking on hypothesis testing, p-values, and stuff. Rather, let&amp;rsquo;s color a map of German election districts (Wahlkreise) according to whether the area is poor AND the AfD gained a lot of votes (and vice versa: the area is rich AND the AfD gained relatively few votes).</description>

      <description>A chloropleth map is a geographic map where statistical information are mapped to certain areas. Let&amp;rsquo;s plot such a chloropleth map in this post.
Packages library(sf) library(stringr) library(tidyverse) library(readxl)  Geo data Best place to get German geo data is from the &amp;ldquo;Bundesamt für Kartografie und Geodäsie (BKG)&amp;rdquo;. One may basically use the data for a purposes unless it is against the law. I have downloaded the data 2017-10-09. More specifically, we are looking at the &amp;ldquo;Verwaltungsgebiete&amp;rdquo; (vg), that is, the administrative areas of the country, ie.</description>

library(stringr) # Textverarbeitung library(tidytext) # Textmining library(pdftools) # PDF einlesen library(downloader) # Daten herunterladen # library(knitr) # HTML-Tabellen library(htmlTable) # HTML-Tabellen library(lsa) # Stopwörter library(SnowballC) # Wörter trunkieren library(wordcloud) # Wordcloud anzeigen library(gridExtra) # Kombinierte Plots library(dplyr) # Datenjudo library(ggplot2) # Visualisierung  Ein einführendes Tutorial zu Textmining; analysiert wird das Parteiprogramm der Partei &amp;ldquo;Alternative für Deutschland&amp;rdquo; (AfD). Vor dem Hintergrund des gestiegenen Zuspruchs von Rechtspopulisten und der großen Gefahr, die von diesem Gedankengut ausdünstet, erscheint mir eine facettenreiche Analyse des Phänomens &amp;ldquo;Rechtspopulismus&amp;rdquo; nötig.</description>
