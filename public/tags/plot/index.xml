      <description>UPDATE: see update below based on comments from nmarkgraf.
The default color scheme in ggplot2 is suitable for many purposes, but, for instance, it is not suitable for b/w printing, and maybe not suitable for persons with limited color perception.
Of course, it is straightforward to edit the color scheme for one given plot. But how to change the default color scheme in ggplot2?
As it turns out, there are some helpful ways to address that â€“ Kudos to @ben-bolker who helped me out on this Stackoverflow post.</description>
