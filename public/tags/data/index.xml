On the project website, the OECD states:
 In recent years, concerns have emerged regarding the fact that macro-economic statistics, such as GDP, donâ€™t provide a sufficiently detailed picture of the living conditions that ordinary people experience. While these concerns were already evident during the years of strong growth and good economic performance that characterised the early part of the decade, the financial and economic crisis has further amplified them.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve put a package on Github featureing some social science data set. Some data came from official sites; my contribution was to clear &amp;lsquo;em up, and render comfortably accessable for automatic inquiry (nice header lines, no special enconding, flat csvs&amp;hellip;.). In other cases it&amp;rsquo;s unpublished data collected by friends, students of mine or myself.
Let&amp;rsquo;s check its contents using a function by Maiasaura from this SO post.

      <description>On September 2017, the 19. German Bundestag has been elected. As of this writing, the parties are still busy sorting out whether they want to part of the government, with whom, and maybe whether they even want to form a government at all. This post is about providing the data in machine friendly form, and in English language.
All data presented in this post regarding this (and previous) elections are published by the Bundeswahlleiter.</description>

      <description>This posts shows data cleaning and preparation for a data set on a statistics test (NHST inference). Data is published under a CC-licence, see here.
Data was collected 2015 to 2017 in statistics courses at the FOM university in different places in Germany. Several colleagues helped to collect the data. Thanks a lot! Now let&amp;rsquo;s enjoy the outcome (and make it freely available to all).
Raw N is 743. The test consists of 40 items which are framed as propositions; students are asked to respond with either &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; to each item.</description>
