      <description>Following up on an earlier post, we will model the voting success of the (most prominent) populist party, AfD, in the recent federal elections. This time, Bayesian modeling techniques will be used, drawing on the excellent textbook my McElreath.
Note that this post is rather a notebook of my thinking, doing, and erring. I’ve made no efforts to hide scaffolding. I think it will be confusing to the uniniate and the initiate as well …</description>

      <title>Playing around with geo mapping: combining demographic data with spatial data</title>

      <description>In this post, we will play around with some basic geo mapping. More preciseyl, we will explore some easy ways to plot a choropleth map.
First, let’s load some geo data from Bundeswahlleiter, and combine it with some socio demographic data from the same source.
Preparation Let’s load some packages:
library(tidyverse) ## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.1 library(sf) library(viridis) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis)) Geo data:
my_path_wahlkreise &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;~/Documents/datasets/geo_maps/btw17_geometrie_wahlkreise_shp/Geometrie_Wahlkreise_19DBT.shp&amp;quot; file.</description>

      <title>Mapping foreigner ratio to AfD election results in the German Wahlkreise</title>

      <description>In a previous post, we have shed some light on the idea that populism - as manifested in AfD election results - is associated with socioeconomic deprivation, be it subjective or objective. We found some supporting pattern in the data, although that hypothesis is far from being complete; ie., most of the variance remained unexplained.
In this post, we test the hypothesis that AfD election results are negatively associated with the proportion of foreign nationals in a Wahlkreis.</description>
