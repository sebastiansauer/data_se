      <description>Images from R are instantly included into (R) markdown files, and the same applies for blogdown posts.
See:
x &amp;lt;- 1:10 plot(x) However, for external images - such as photos - things are more complicated. First, all is still fine, if an image is found on some URL/server on the internet:
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/310px-R_logo.svg.png&amp;quot;) Of course, one can apply direct markdown syntax for including external images:
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/310px-R_logo.svg.png){width=20%} Now assume we are in an R project that gives the base for a blogdown blog.</description>

      <description> How to include external images to a hugo post?
Suppose we have a file img1.png in project1, ie., project1/img1.png. Do this:
Copy your folder with images to static/. Use this path in your blogdown post: /project/img1.png.   Mind the leading slash!  Example time This code (on my machine) ![](/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png){ width=&amp;quot;20%&amp;quot; }
renders this:
Note the nice width option.
 Knitr way The knitr way works similarly:
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png&amp;quot;)  </description>

      <description>My blog at https://sebastiansauer.github.io/posts/ has moved. It is now here! This is the new home of my blog. In (the unlikely) case you are asking yourself “Why did you move your blog?”, here is the answer.
I was using Jekyll at Github pages which is great as long as you do not have a lot of R in your posts. But I did have a lot of R in my posts.</description>
