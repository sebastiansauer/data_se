      <description> How to include external images to a hugo post?
Suppose we have a file img1.png in project1, ie., project1/img1.png. Do this:
Copy your folder with images to static/. Use this path in your blogdown post: /project/img1.png.   Mind the leading slash!  Example time This code (on my machine) ![](/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png){ width=&amp;quot;20%&amp;quot; }
renders this:
Note the nice width option.
 Knitr way The knitr way works similarly:
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png&amp;quot;)  </description>

I was using Jekyll at Github pages which is great as long as you do not have a lot of R in your posts. But I did have a lot of R in my posts.</description>
