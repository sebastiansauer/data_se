      <description>Load packages  Course description Models and modeling are of pivotal importance in many sciences, not only for providing an explanation of nature en miniature (theoretical models), but also for gauging how closely the empirical data at hand match the theoretical model. Translating a theoretical model into statistical language is called statistical modeling and provides the guiding principle in this introductory course. We will explore how causal and non-causal associations can be translated and tested using simple linear statistical models.</description>

      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse)  Intro A Gamma distribution is useful for modeling positive, right skewed data such as waiting times; it is a continuous function.
In this post, we’ll illustrate some properties of the Gamma distribution by simulating a toy example.
 Simulate data and define structural model Let \(X\) be a discrete variable following uniform distribution, and \(x_i \in \{1,2,3\}\).
set.seed(42) n &amp;lt;- 1000 X &amp;lt;- sample(x = c(1,2,3), size = n, replace = TRUE) hist(X) Let \(y_i = 0.</description>

A lot of hasty more or less useful research is being conducted.
One of the circulating claims is: “There Corona growth rate in country X is higher than in country Y!”
Let’s assume some doubling (growth) rate:
double_rates &amp;lt;- 5 double_rate_chosen &amp;lt;- 5 # sample(double_rates, size = 1)  Two countries with equal Covid-19 growth rate Consider two countries, A und B, with the same Covid-19 growth rate.</description>
