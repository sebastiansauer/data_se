      <description>Since some time, there’s a wrapper for ggplot2 available, bundled in the package ggformula. One nice thing is that in that it plays nicely with the popular R package mosaic. mosaic provides some useful functions for modeling along with a tamed and consistent syntax. In this post, we will discuss some “ornaments”, that is, some details of beautification of a plot. I confess that every one will deem it central, but in some cases in comes in handy to know how to “refine” a plot using ggformula.</description>

      <description>A frequent job in data visualizing is to present summary statistics. In this post, I show one way to plot mean values between groups using the tidyverse approach in comparison to the mosaic way.
library(tidyverse) data(mtcars) library(mosaic) library(knitr) library(sjmisc) library(sjPlot) Visualizing mean values between two groups First, let’s compute the mean hp for automatic cars (am == 0) vs. manual cars (am == 1).
mtcars %&amp;gt;% group_by(am) %&amp;gt;% summarise(hp_am = mean(hp)) -&amp;gt; hp_am Now just hand over this data frame of summarized data to ggplot:</description>

      <description>In this post, we will play around with some basic geo mapping. More preciseyl, we will explore some easy ways to plot a choropleth map.
First, let’s load some geo data from Bundeswahlleiter, and combine it with some socio demographic data from the same source.
Preparation Let’s load some packages:
library(tidyverse) ## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.1 library(sf) library(viridis) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis)) Geo data:
my_path_wahlkreise &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;~/Documents/datasets/geo_maps/btw17_geometrie_wahlkreise_shp/Geometrie_Wahlkreise_19DBT.shp&amp;quot; file.</description>

      <title>Error bars for interaction effects with nominal variables</title>

      <description>Moderator effects (ie., interaction or synergy effects) are a topic of frequent interest in many sciences braches. A lot ink has been spilled over this topic (so did I, eg., here).
However, in that post I did now show how to visualize error in case of nominal (categorical) independent variable, and categorical moderator.
Luckily, visualization of this case is quite straight forward with ggplot2.
First, some data and packages to be loaded:</description>
