      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) Rowwwise operations are a quite frequent operations in data analysis. The R language environment is particularly strong in column wise operations. This is due to technical reasons, as data frames are internally built as column-by-column structures, hence column wise operations are simple, rowwise more difficult.
This post looks at some rather general way to comput rowwise statistics. Of course, numerous ways exist and there are quite a few tutorials around, notably by Jenny Bryant, and by Emil Hvitfeldt to name a few.</description>

      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse)  Basic testing for equality Testing for equality in a kind of very basic function in computer (and data) science. There is a straightforward function in R to test for equality:
identical(1, 1) #&amp;gt; [1] TRUE identical(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;) #&amp;gt; [1] TRUE identical(1, 2) #&amp;gt; [1] FALSE identical(1, NA) #&amp;gt; [1] FALSE However this get more complicated if we want to compare more than two elements. One way to achieve this is to compute the number of the different items.</description>
