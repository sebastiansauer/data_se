      <description>Writing a technical or academic report, or even a presentation, it is sensible to render the (R) code in such a writing reproducible. Same thing applies when asking for help at StackOverflow: youâ€™ll be asked for a reprex.
One aspect for rendering a report reproducible is to include details on the version of packages needed. The well-known command sessionInf() provides the building blocks for that. However, the output of that function can feel verbose, and it consumes a lot of space.</description>

      <description>A DOI is useful feature to any electronic document. What the ID number in your passport is to you is the DOI to a document. It simply helps to make sure you address the &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; you want to address.
Similarly, there may exists several &amp;ldquo;Joachims Zwiwwelkoecks&amp;rdquo; in this world (well, it may or may not be the case). However, if any of this person gets his (or her) unique ID (could by a simple number), then we would in principle always be certain that we address the right person.</description>

      <description>Many tools exist for academic writing including the notorious W.O.R.D.; but many more are out there. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at those tools, and discuss what&amp;rsquo;s important (what we expect the tool to deliver, eg., beautiful typesetting).
Typical tools for academic writing  MS Word: A &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; choice, relied upon by myriads of white collar workers&amp;hellip; I myself have used it extensively for academic writing; the main advantage being its simplicity, that is, well, everybody knows it, and knows more or less how to handle it.</description>
