      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse)  Starters Assume you have this data frame:
x &amp;lt;- tribble( ~ colA, ~colB, ~colC, NA, 1, NA, 1, NA, 1 ) x #&amp;gt; # A tibble: 2 x 3 #&amp;gt; colA colB colC #&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; #&amp;gt; 1 NA 1 NA #&amp;gt; 2 1 NA 1 But you want this one:
y &amp;lt;- tribble( ~ colA, ~colB, ~colC, 1, 1, 1 ) y #&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3 #&amp;gt; colA colB colC #&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; #&amp;gt; 1 1 1 1 That is, you’d like to collapse rows so that if there’s a NA in a column it is replaced by the value found in some other line.</description>

      <description>More on programming with dplyr: converting quosures to strings In this post, we have programmed a simple function using dplyr&amp;rsquo;s programming capabilities based on tidyeval; for more intro to programming with dplyr, see here.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go one step further and programm a function where a quosure will be turned to a string. Why this? Because quite a number of functions out there except strings as input parameters.</description>

      <description>The one basic idea of dplyr is that each function should focus on one job. That&amp;rsquo;s why there are no functions such as compute_sumamries_by_group_with_robust_variants(df). Rather, summarising and grouping are seen as different jobs which should be accomplished by different functions. And, in turn, that&amp;rsquo;s why group_by, the grouping function of dplyr, is of considerable importance: this function should do the grouping for each operation whatsoever.
Let&amp;rsquo;s load all tidyverse libraries in one go:</description>

      <description>Like for [others], Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s dplyr, and more generally, the tidyverse approach has considerably changed the I do data analyses. Most notably, the pipe (coming from magrittr by Stefan Milton Bache, see here) has creeped into nearly every analyses I, do.
That is, is every analyses except for functions, and other non-interactive stuff. In those programming contexts, the dplyr way does not work, due to its non standard evaluation or NSE for short.</description>

      <description>The R package dplyr has some attractive features; some say, this packkage revolutionized their workflow. At any rate, I like it a lot, and I think it is very helpful.
In this post, I would like to share some useful (I hope) ideas (&amp;ldquo;tricks&amp;rdquo;) on filter, one function of dplyr. This function does what the name suggests: it filters rows (ie., observations such as persons). The addressed rows will be kept; the rest of the rows will be dropped.</description>

      <description>One idea of problem solving is, or should be, I think, that one should tackle problems of high complexity, but not too high. That sounds trivial, cooler tone would be &amp;ldquo;as hard as possible, as easy as necessary&amp;rdquo; which is basically the same thing.
In software development including Rstats, a similar principle applies. Sounds theoretical, I admit. So see here some lines of code that has bitten me recently:
obs &amp;lt;- c(1,2,3) pred &amp;lt;- c(1,2,4) monster &amp;lt;- 1 - (sum((obs - pred)^2))/(sum((obs - mean(obs))^2)) monster  ## [1] 0.</description>
