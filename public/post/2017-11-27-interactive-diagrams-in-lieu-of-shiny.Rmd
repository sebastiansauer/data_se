One frequent use of the Shiny server software is displaying interactive data diagrams. The pro of using
Shiny is the great flexibility; much more than "just graphics" can be done. Basically Shiny provides a flexible
GUI for your R program. *But* if you simply aiming at displaying or exploring some data interactively, a much
simplor approach may do it for you; there are some nice libraries available in R for that. The aim of this post is to present some examples, and to that's easy to use them in R.

The point is that the computations necessary for interactivity are done by a JavaScript rendered by the browser, ie., on the local machine. 
No server reosources are needed. In addition, it appears to be a stable technology. Popular JS libraries which are connected with R included [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [D3](https://d3js.org/), among others. In fact, as of today, 92 JS libraries have been linked to the R library [htmlwidgets](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/).


As quite a bit of JS is computed in the background, this site may take a while to render.




```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(mtcars)
glimpse(mtcars)
```


# Mouseover

Highlighting values by hovering the mose over some plot area is a builtin feature in the respective libraries.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x  = factor(cyl), y = mpg, color = factor(cyl)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") -> p1
p1
```

Introducing plotly:

```{r}
library(plotly)

ggplotly(p1)

```





Say you want a plot where some data cats (group A vs. group B etc.) can be selected. Plotly supports that out of the box for subgroups; click on the `cyl` values in the legend of the plot above. Plotly does that out of the box. JavaScript inside.

BTW, zooming is also possible in Plotly.




# Rbokeh

Rbokey is another JS library hooked to R. Subgrouping is not possibly, as far as I have seen in the first instant.

```{r}
library(rbokeh)
figure() %>%
  ly_points(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, data = iris,
    color = Species, glyph = Species,
    hover = list(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
```

Rbokeh allows for easy map plotting.




```{r}
library(maps)
data(world.cities)
caps <- subset(world.cities, capital == 1)
caps$population <- prettyNum(caps$pop, big.mark = ",")
figure(width = 800, height = 450, padding_factor = 0) %>%
  ly_map("world", col = "gray") %>%
  ly_points(long, lat, data = caps, size = 5,
    hover = c(name, country.etc, population))
```

A maps example, taken from [this source](https://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/#preview).

# Scatter3D

Scatter3D looks quite promising, too; eg., subdata cats are possible.


```{r}
library(scatterD3)
mtcars$names <- rownames(mtcars)
scatterD3(data = mtcars, x = wt, y = mpg, lab = names,
          col_var = cyl, symbol_var = am,
          xlab = "Weight", ylab = "Mpg", col_lab = "Cylinders",
          symbol_lab = "Manual transmission")
```



# pairsD3

This example is taken from [here](https://github.com/garthtarr/pairsD3). 


```{r results = "asis"}
data(iris)
library(pairsD3)
pairsD3(iris[,1:4],group=iris[,5])
```

As it appears not to run in this environment, check out [this example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063663).

# Radarchart

Consider [this example](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/radarchart), which does not show in this environment, but ran on my local machine.

```{r}
library(radarchart)

labs <- c("Communicator", "Data Wangler", "Programmer",
          "Technologist",  "Modeller", "Visualizer")

scores <- list(
  "Rich" = c(9, 7, 4, 5, 3, 7),
  "Andy" = c(7, 6, 6, 2, 6, 9),
  "Aimee" = c(6, 5, 8, 4, 7, 6)
)

chartJSRadar(scores = scores, labs = labs, maxScale = 10)
```

## GoogleVis

[GoogleVis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis_examples.html) is very versatile, too. Consider this example:

```{r}
library(googleVis)
mtcars_cyl <- mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  select(rowname, cyl, am) %>% 
  count(cyl, am) %>% 
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl))
mtcars_bars <- gvisBarChart(mtcars_cyl)
plot(mtcars_bars)
```

The different bars can be selected and highlighted. 

Many more plot types are available.
