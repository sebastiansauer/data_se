      <title>Change standard theme of ggplot</title>

      <description>ggplot2 is customizeable. Frankly, one can change a heap of details - not everything probably, but a lot. Of course, one can add a theme to the ggplot call, in order to change the theme. However, a more catch-it-all approach would be to change the standard theme of ggplot itself. In this post, we‚Äôll investigate this option.
Load some data and the right packages:
data(mtcars) library(tidyverse) Here‚Äôs the standard theme of ggplot, let‚Äôs have a look at it</description>

      <description>Dumbbell plots can be used to show differences between two groups. Bob Rudis demonstrated a beautiful application of such plots using ggplot2 board methods.
In this plot, I will explain or comment his code, and adapt a few changes.
First, load some packages.
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggalt) Let‚Äôs make up some data. Tip: Make up some data conveniently in Excel, copy it to the clipboard, and then paste it as tribble (see below) into R.</description>

      <title>Playing around with dataviz: Comparing distributions between groups</title>

      <description>What‚Äô a nice way to display distributional differences between a (larger) number of groups? Boxplots is one way to go. In addition, the raw data may be shown as dots, but should be demphasized. Third, a trend or big picture comparing the groups will make sense in some cases.
Ok, based on this reasoning, let‚Äôs do som visualizing. Let‚Äôs load some data (movies), and the usual culprits of packages.</description>

      <description>In this plot, we are looking into some ways of displaying association between (two) quantitative variables, aka correlation. Our goal is to present a rich representation of the correlation.
Let‚Äôs take the dataset flights as an example.
data(flights, package = &amp;quot;nycflights13&amp;quot;) library(tidyverse) ## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.1 library(viridis) flights %&amp;gt;% filter(arr_delay &amp;lt; 100, dep_delay &amp;lt; 100) %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay, color = origin)) + geom_point(alpha = .</description>

      <description>This posts shows how easy it can be to build an visually pleasing plot. We will use hrbrmster‚Äôs ggcounty, which is an R package at this Github repo. Graphics engine is as mostly in my plots, Hadley Wickhams ggplot. All build on R. Standing on shoulders‚Ä¶
Disclaimer: This example heavily draws on hrbrmster example on this page. All credit is due to Rudy, and those on whose work he built up on.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs visualize a GLM (logistic regression).
First laod some data:
data(tips, package = &amp;quot;reshape2&amp;quot;) Compute a glm:
glm_tips &amp;lt;- glm(sex ~ tip, data = tips, family = &amp;quot;binomial&amp;quot;) Plot the model using mosaic:
library(mosaic) ## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.1 plotModel(glm_tips) The curve does not look really s-typed (ogive) but that‚Äôs ok because the data suggest not a strong trend. The plot is not very beautiful either, but hey - it‚Äôs quick to produce üòÅ.</description>

      <title>Interactive diagrams in lieu of shiny?</title>
      <link>/2017/11/27/interactive-diagrams-in-lieu-of-shiny/</link>

      <description>One frequent use of the Shiny server software is displaying interactive data diagrams. The pro of using Shiny is the great flexibility; much more than ‚Äújust graphics‚Äù can be done. Basically Shiny provides a flexible GUI for your R program. But if you simply aiming at displaying or exploring some data interactively, a much simplor approach may do it for you; there are some nice libraries available in R for that.</description>

      <description>Here come some stunning examples of data visualizations, all built with R. R code of each diagram is available at the source. Enjoy! #beautiful.
 UPDATE: I&amp;rsquo;ve included links to the R source!
 Plotting geo maps along with subplots in ggplot2 I like this one by Ilya Kashnitsky:
Similarly, by the same author:

Great work, @ikashnitsky!
