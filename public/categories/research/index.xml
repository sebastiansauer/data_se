      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse)  Why small effects need big samples That’s a question that periodically comes up in class. Suppose someone is planning a study. As demanded by her teacher, she computes the needed sample size upfront. So the question arises: Given some to-be-achieved level of power (80%), some effect size, and some other details: How large does my sample need to be?
Some students are puzzled by the fact that small effects need larges samples.</description>

      <description>Collecting data over the internet used to be fancy, some twenty years or so ago. Nowadays it can be considered standard, if not old school (collecting data using mobile apps is where the cool kids go at the moment). However, there’s one noteable exception: Collecting reaction time data over the internet remained a challenge. The reason is simply a technological artefact in that an html response time may vary, vary too much as to invalidate the signal from some behavorial reaction time research study.</description>
