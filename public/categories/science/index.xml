      <description>Here are my slides for my Workshop on Markdown and Git (2019-09-16). Note that you need to be online to render the slides (due to heavy use of JS).
The Rmd source code (master file) can be found here.

      <description>There are several popular citation manager software packages around. I used to work with Mendeley in class, but I stopped using it since it was acquired by El$sevier. Luckily there are good alternatives around, particularly Zotero. Zotero features a Word (MS Word, Libre Word) plugin, which is a must have for many of us. The more technically inclined folks will use Bibtex. Good news is that Zotero syncs it Library to Bibtex.</description>
